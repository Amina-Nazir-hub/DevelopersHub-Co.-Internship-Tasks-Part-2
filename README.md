## 1. Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

### Task Objective
Cluster customers based on spending habits and propose marketing strategies tailored to each segment.

### Approach
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in customer data.
- Applied K-Means Clustering to segment customers.
- Used PCA or t-SNE for visualizing the clusters.
- Developed strategies for each segment based on identified spending behavior.

### Results and Findings
- Identified multiple distinct customer segments.
- High-spending customers were targeted for premium marketing campaigns.
- Low-spending or occasional customers were targeted with promotional offers.
- Visualization confirmed clear separation between segments, aiding in actionable insights.

## 2. Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting

### Task Objective
Forecast short-term household energy usage using historical data.

### Approach
- Parsed and resampled time series data.
- Engineered time-based features such as hour of day, weekday/weekend.
- Compared ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost models for forecasting accuracy.
- Visualized actual vs. forecasted energy usage.

### Results and Findings
- XGBoost provided the most accurate forecasts for short-term predictions.
- ARIMA and Prophet models captured seasonality but underperformed on sudden changes.
- Insights helped identify peak usage hours and potential energy-saving opportunities.

- Displayed key performance indicators (KPIs) including Total Sales, Profit, and Top 5 Customers.
- Integrated charts and visuals for interactive analysis.

### Results and Findings
- Dashboard allowed dynamic filtering and exploration of sales data.
- Identified top-performing regions, categories, and customers.
